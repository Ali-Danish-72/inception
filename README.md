# Inception (42 Project)

## üõ†Ô∏è Overview

**Inception** is a system administration and DevOps project from the 42 curriculum. The objective is to virtualize and containerize a functional multi-service web infrastructure using Docker. This project was built using a Debian base image and configured manually from scratch using Dockerfiles.

This repository contains a fully containerized environment with multiple services communicating over a custom Docker network.

- Access to the Docker socket for Portainer is restricted to allow container-level management only.

## üîß Key Features

- Custom Docker network and volumes for persistent data.
- Self-signed certificates generated dynamically in containers.
- PHP-FPM used for both WordPress and Adminer.
- NGINX configured with two separate server blocks for WordPress and Adminer.
